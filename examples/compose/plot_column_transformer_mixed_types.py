===================================
Column Transformer with Mixed Types
===================================

This example illustrates how to apply different preprocessing and
feature extraction pipelines to different subsets of features,
using :class:`sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer`.
This is particularly handy for the case of datasets that contain
heterogeneous data types, since we may want to scale the
numeric features and one-hot encode the categorical ones.

In this example, the numeric data is standard-scaled after
mean-imputation, while the categorical data is one-hot
encoded after imputing missing values with a new category
(``'missing'``).

Finally, the preprocessing pipeline is integrated in a
full prediction pipeline using :class:`sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`,
together with a simple classification model.

# Introspecting the coefficients values of the classifier
###############################################################################
# The coefficients of the final classification step of the pipeline gives an
# idea how each feature impacts the likelihood of survival assuming that the
# usual linear model assumptions hold (uncorrelated features, linear
# separability, homoschedastic errors...) which we do not verify in this
# example.
#
# To get error bars we perform cross-validation and compute the mean and
# standard deviation for each coefficient accross CV splits. Because we use a
# standard scaler on the numerical features, the coefficient weights gives us
# an idea on how much the log odds of surviving are impacted by a change in
# this dimension contrasted to the mean. Note that the categorical features
# here are overspecified which makes it slightly harder to interpret because of
# the information redundancy.
#
# We can see that the linear model coefficients are in agreement with the
# historical reports: people in higher classes and therefore in the upper decks
# were the first to reach the lifeboats, and often, priority was given to women
# and children.
#
# Note that conditionned on the "pclass_x" one-hot features, the "fare"
# numerical feature does not seem to be significantly predictive. If we drop
# the "pclass" feature, then higher "fare" values would appear significantly
# correlated with a higher likelihood of survival as the "fare" and "pclass"
# features have a strong statistical dependency.
